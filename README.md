# Eternum Casino

This is a project that attempts to extend the functionality of the Eternum by adding a casino.

Most of my contributions can be found in `contracts/*` as well as `client/src/components/worldmap/casinos*`. The rest is just boiler plate and forked code

I also made a fun attempt at the UI and it seems to work. However, it is pure garbage and should be completely redone.

To run the project, go to
`sdk/packages/eternum` && `bun install && bun run build` <br> 
then `cd client && bun install && bun dev`. It would run on production Eternum contracts by default so no need for any additional setup.

The casinos are just beside every hyperstructure. They are quite noticable :)) I need to sleep now.
